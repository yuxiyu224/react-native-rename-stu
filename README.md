> This package assumes that you created your react-native project using `react-native init` or `expo bare workflow`.

**Note:** This package does not attempt to properly rename build artifacts such as `ios/build` or Cocoa Pod installation targets. After renaming your project you should clean, build, and reinstall third party dependencies to get it running properly with the new name.

### Usage
```
$ npx react-native-rename@latest "new_name"
```

> With custom Bundle Identifier
```
$ npx react-native-rename@latest "new_name" -b "bundle_identifier"
```

### Example

##### First, Switch to new branch (optional but recommended)
```
$ git checkout -b rename-app
```
##### Then, Rename your app
```
$ npx react-native-rename "Travel App"
```
With custom Bundle Identifier
```
$ npx react-native-rename "Travel App" -b "com.junedomingo.travelapp"
```
